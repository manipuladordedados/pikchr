Pikchr is based on pic, a historically important tool for making diagrams. It's been updated to be safer and more modern, removing dangerous features. It's made by the same people who created SQLite.

Pikchr doesn't have official versions for Windows, so many people can't use it. By setting up a CI on GitHub, we can make Pikchr available for everyone.
